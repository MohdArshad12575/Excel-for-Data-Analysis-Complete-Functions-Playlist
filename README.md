# Excel-for-Data-Analysis-Complete-Functions-Playlist
This series is designed for data analysts, data scientists, and students who want to master Excel from the ground up.  Why this playlist? I don’t just explain functions – I show you how they are applied in real-world data problems. Each video comes with a practice dataset so you can learn hands-on.
